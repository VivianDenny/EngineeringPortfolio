I had to split the design in half to create the mold halves, fasten them together, and then use an injection mold. I also had to consider the constraints that came with using a CNC mill while designing the part, such as having the widest elements at the top of the mold halves in order for the machine to cut each design and balancing the smoothness of the mold with how long it would take to mill. The design had to be modified because air was getting trapped in the mold, creating pockets in the final product, so I drilled a few small holes in the mold, and kept injecting plastic until a satisfactory product was obtained.";

Plus, this allowed me to explore using a machine I had yet to try: the CNC wood router. After designing and cutting out the tabletop parts, I used the bandsaw to cut long metal rods to form the legs. I used the metal worker to bend the rods and soldered them to metal plates to be drilled into the tabletop.

The end goal is to be able to compete in the RoboSub competition, having the submarine complete a variety of tasks, like gathering objects or going through gates.

In my junior year as president of the Assistive Technology club, I expanded the club from 4 members to 12, raised awareness about what our club does on various media outlets, and organized our club to work with additional projects. I've seen the progress in each student we work with, watching them grow from struggling to say a few words to creating sentences alone due to our club. Starting the club with no coding background gives me first-hand experience learning to code through the club, and allows me to share this insight with new members. I also organize weekly outside of school meetings to create new materials, delegate tasks to club members, and plan field trips to visit the students. <br>You can view our media features on <a href='https://www.fox5dc.com/video/1025707' class='popLinks' target='_blank'>Fox</a>, <a target='_blank' class='popLinks' href='https://wtop.com/fairfax-county/2022/01/fairfax-co-school-club-connects-high-schoolers-with-nonverbal-elementary-students/'>WTOP</a>, <a target='_blank' class='popLinks' href='https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/get-up-dc/assistive-technology-club-at-thomas-jefferson-high-school-helps-nonverbal-elementary-school-students-better-communicate/65-848bab63-d739-478f-9ee4-c05d75e747fc'>WUSA</a>, <a class='popLinks' target='_blank' href='https://wjla.com/news/local/gifted-hs-students-thomas-jefferson-high-school-special-needs-heads-hearts-to-help-non-verbal-es-students-communicate'>WJLA</a>, and <a class='popLinks' target='_blank' href='https://www.fcps.edu/blog/tjhsst-students-use-coding-and-creativity-communicate-non-verbal-elementary-students'>FCPS Media</a>.";
